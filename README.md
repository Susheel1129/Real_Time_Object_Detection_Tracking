# Real-Time Object Detection & Tracking

This project implements a **real-time object detection and tracking system** using **YOLOv8**.  
The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset with four classes — *person, bottle, cell phone, spoon, clocks etc.* — achieving **over 75% detection accuracy** on the validation set.

---

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to detect and track multiple objects in real time using video streams or webcam feeds.  
It leverages **Ultralytics YOLOv8** for detection and **OpenCV** for visualization and tracking.

---

##  Key Features
-  Fine-tuned **YOLOv8 model** for high-accuracy detection  
-  **Real-time object detection & tracking** using OpenCV  
-  Supports both **image and video inference**  
-  Achieves **>75% mean Average Precision (mAP)**  
-  Modular code design for easy customization and experimentation
